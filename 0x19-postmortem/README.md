# Apache 500 Error Debugging Adventure

**Objective:** Use the magical powers of `strace` to uncover the mystery behind Apache's infuriating 500 errors, fix the issue, and then elegantly automate it using Puppet!

## Unmasking the Enigma

**Tools of the Trade:** `strace`, `tmux`, `curl`

**Step 1: Strace to the Rescue**
1. Fire up `tmux` and split the screen. In one pane, launch `strace` to peek into Apache's secrets: `strace -p <apache_process_id> -e trace=write`
2. In another pane, get your trusty `curl` ready to provoke the 500 error: `curl -I http://localhost`

**Step 2: The Aha Moment**
While strace scrolls like an ancient scroll, look out for oddities like failed system calls or missing files. Bingo! We see Apache's whisperings about a missing configuration file.

## Eureka! The Fix

**Discovering the Culprit:** Apache was hunting for the `httpd.conf` file in `/etc/httpd/`, but it was playing hide-and-seek.

**Banishing the Gremlins:**
1. Dash to the rescue: `sudo nano /etc/httpd/httpd.conf`
2. Give Apache the treasure map: Point it to the right `httpd.conf` path.

## Puppets on a String

**0-strace_is_your_friend.pp - A Puppet Masterpiece:**
```puppet
class apache_fix {
  file { '/etc/httpd/httpd.conf':
    ensure  => file,
    source  => 'puppet:///modules/apache_fix/httpd.conf', # Place your httpd.conf in the module directory
    require => Package['httpd'],  # Assuming you have a package resource for installing httpd
    notify  => Service['httpd'],
  }
}

include apache_fix
